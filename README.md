## 🌍 Introducing **PotherPanchali.AI**
### _AI That Plans, Roads That Sing!_

Welcome to **PotherPanchali.AI** — your intelligent travel companion inspired by the cinematic brilliance of Satyajit Ray's iconic film _Pather Panchali_, which translates to _"Song of the Little Road."_ 

In Bengali:  
- **Poth** means “road” — the journey.  
- **Panchali** represents a traditional narrative — a poetic tale that captures the essence of life’s simple yet profound experiences.

Just like the film that threads together life’s struggles and joys into an unforgettable story, **PotherPanchali.AI** aspires to be the digital _panchali_ of modern travelers — especially those seeking inspiration, clarity, and connection in planning their journeys.
